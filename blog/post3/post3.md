# To be

I have an idea of who I want to be. In my head, I like to entertain the idea of being that person, but it can only exist in my imaginations, right? And so I thought... 

But, the choice is handed to us everyday. What is means to be human is that we have liberty to choose how we interpret what happens to us today, and I how we respond to these interpretations with our actions. By deliberately acting in our daily life, we can choose to commit ourselves to living out the kind of life that we imagine for ourselves. 

There is no limitations in what a person can believe themselves to be. Over time, we become a closer approximations of the person that we interpret ourselves to be and act like in the world. 

Now an interesting question is how we are to be? It doesn't have to be a challening questions to answer, but it is often the source of much existential angst. The answer is to be the person that when you think long and hard about what you love, what you think is good for the others and your life, you are satisfied with the answer. The fact of the matter is that even after this filtering process, you will still end up with a tyranny of choices --but this is good. 

All that is left is to choose anyone of those options and commit to it. Make the courage to be that person, a habit. The decision to be commands courage, but you must make the choice to be in spite of all the worry and judgement that may come your way for not having chosen the "right" path. You must block out the noise and dive into the good thing you have chosen with a clear conscience and an earnest heart.
