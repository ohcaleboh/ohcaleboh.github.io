# An Odd Source of Motivation

When I was in Elementary School, I became obsessed with an online role play game (RPG) called Runescape. 

For those of you who are not familiar with the game, you start off choosing an avatar that you use to complete missions in an adventurous digital world. Foisted into this new world, you start off as a level 0 avatar (i.e., newb). You then get to choose differnt skill sets to train your avatar in through engagement in different activities. The goal is to one day become a straight savage (level 100+ w/ full dragon armour, brandishing a double handed sword). 

Anyway, I remember being physically at school during the day, but my mind would be in that magical runescape world shooting arrows at goblins from behind a fence --watching with glee as my archery level slowly ticked up a level over time. From an outside perspective, it would seem like deviant behavior --seeing this kid clicking on globlins for hours everyday just to see a number tick up on the screen at a snail's pace. 

But, I am happy that I spent a good chunk of youth on Runescape. This desire to improve the skills of my avatar in the digital world easily transitioned into my real life when I matured a bit --I confess, I relapsed into playing Runescape in my Junior year of high school, just checking up on the archer calebcaleb12 whom I raised so lovingly to be a MF'in beast, especially in the wilderness where people killing (PKing) is legal.

I would say that adopting this mentality towards improvement has served me very well in my life time. I was never the greatest in terms of natural ability at acadmeics or atheltics. But, at an early age, I can admit that I was pretty good at identifying the skill sets that I knew to be most valuable within my respective communities. Once I had known what the skill set was, the rest was second nature, each day I woke up and did the equivalent of reptitive "clicking on globlins" which looked like going to the gym to lift everyday, reading a little bit each day, writing a line of code each day, writiing in my thoughts in a journal each day. 

You see, Runescape taught me something early on in life that people don't realize till much later in life: 
1. Everyone starts off at level 0 in the beginning. 
2. We always have choices to make small deicisions that end up deciding the person that we one day become.
3. Improvement takes consistent effort over a long period of time.
4. You must enjoy the journey and learn to interpret the "boring & tedious" stuff as exciting and meaningful to become good at anything.
